✅ Corrected version:

print("welcome to the band name generator")
city = input("which city did you grow up in?\n")
pet = input("what is your pet name?\n")
print("your band name could be " + city + " " + pet)


```
print("your band name could be " + city + " " + pet)
"your band name could be "
→ This is a fixed string (always the same text).

+ operator with strings
→ In Python, + joins (concatenates) strings together.
Example: "Hello " + "World" → "Hello World"
Each piece is a block. You join them with +.```


OR using f-strings (cleaner):

print("welcome to the band name generator")
city = input("which city did you grow up in?\n")
pet = input("what is your pet name?\n")
print(f"your band name could be {city} {pet}")
